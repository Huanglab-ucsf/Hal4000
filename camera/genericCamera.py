# Base class for handling the control and display of the
# data from one (or more) cameras.
#
# Classes that sub-class this also need to include a 
# separate function getMode() which should return
# one of the following strings, depending on what sort
# of UI is appropriate for the camera:
# 
# 1. "single" - classic single window HAL UI.
# 2. "detached" - the camera window is separate.
# 3. "dual" - the camera window is separate and there
#             are two cameras.
